          <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>It all started in high school with a Pentax ME Super 35mm camera and a decidely uncool Honda CB360.  The Honda CB360 was not the visual spark behind my
          current work, but it was the first of many motorcycles to come.  When I moved to Seattle in 1998, I started exploring the area on two wheels with a
          Honda CBR600 and later a Honda VFR800 Interceptor.</p>
        <p>On the automobile side, my initial inspiration was a photograph of my dad with his 1958 Corvette, which sadly he sold, as so many do, when the kids
          arrived.  But I loved the lines of that car and the subsequent generations of Corvettes and, like any teenage boy, dreamed about driving all kinds of sports cars.
          I would have to wait until much later before that dream was realized.</p>
        </p>
        <p>Photography was a bit slower to develop in my life.  It wasn't until the advent of digital photography and post-processing software like Photoshop
          that I really started to get into it.  The immediate feedback of digital photography and the unprecedented ability to manipulate an image allowed
        me to reach new levels of creative expression.</p>
        <p>Fast forward to today and I'm driving instead of riding.  I've had the pleasure of photographing some amazing cars and motorcycles and I'm
          always looking for the next great shot.  I hope you enjoy the images on this site and I look forward to working with you to capture the beauty of
          your ride.</p>

          <h2>Current Photography</h2>
          <h4>On Location</h4>
          <p>Living in the Pacific Northwest gives us a great variety of options for locations, from industrial urban to
            lush forests to the beautiful coastline.  I love to shoot in the early morning or late afternoon to take advantage
            of the best light.  I'm always looking for new locations and I'm open to suggestions.
          </p>
          <h4>Light Painting</h4>
          <p>Light painting combines the interest of an outdoor location with the lighting effects of a studio.
            This is my favorite type of photography because it allows me to create a unique image that is
            not possible with traditional photography.  Typically, this will involve multiple shots on location
            and then blending them together in post-processing.  The results can be stunning.</p>
          </p>
          <h4>Studio</h4>
          <p>Currently, I am only doing "studio" photoshoots for motorcycles due to size constraints.</p>
